# Deployment of BERT Embedding - BiLSTM Model

## Text Classification 
This is a deep learning model deployment as a requirement for my Undergraduate Thesis. I have presented the Text Classification model in an basic minimal UI using Flask Web Framework and Gradio GUI. 

This model was deployed in local machine. Deep learning model that I used is BiLSTM with BERT Embedding. 

I don't open my model.h5 for public. So if you interested to my model, please contact me.
