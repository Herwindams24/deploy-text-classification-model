# Deployment of BERT Embedding - BiLSTM Model

## Text Classification 
This is a deep learning model deployment required for my undergraduate thesis. I have presented the text classification model in a basic minimal UI using Flask Web Framework and Gradio GUI.

This model was deployed  on a local machine. The deep learning model that I used is BiLSTM with BERT Embedding.

I don't open my model.h5 for public. So if you interested in my model, please kindly contact me.
